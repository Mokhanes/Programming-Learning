/*
 * Class By Ranjith (FS1 & FS2)
 *   
 * Frequency Array Concepts:
 * 
 * Key Insights:
 *      1] Use Return Statements insted of flag variables
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Questions:
 *      1] Pnagram - All the alphabets should be present in the string
 *      2] Anagram - Two strings should have same characters with same frequency
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Two Pointer and Sliding Window:
 *     1] Use two pointers to represent a window
 *     2] Move the right pointer to expand the window
 * 
 *     1] Binary Seacrch
 *      2] Perfix sum
 *      3] Optimization Problem [Maximun or Minimun or Sub Array]  --> Sliding window, DP, Greedy 
 *      4] Duplicates - HasMap, HasSet, CoutingArray, FreuenceArray 
 *      5] Needed Substring - HashMap, HashSet, Sliding Window
 *      6] Pair Sum - Two Pointer, HashMap
 *      7] Triplet Sum - Two Pointer, HashMap
 *      8] Subsets - Backtracking, Bit Manipulation
 *      9] Subsequences - Backtracking, DP
 *     10] Subarray - Sliding Window, Prefix Sum, HashMap
 *   Permutaion Combination - Backtracking
 *   
 * Binary Seach - Sorted Array/Range
 * Tow Pointer - Two Sum, Tree Sum, Triplet Sum, Four Sum, Remove Duplicates, Container With Most Water, Move Zro to Laste 
 * Sliding Window - Max Sum Subarray of Size K, Smallest Subarray with a given sum, Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters, Fruits into Baskets, No Repeat Substring, Longest Repeating Character Replacement, Minimum Window Substring
 * Hasing - HashSet, HashMap (Two Sum, Tree Sum ---> Unsorted Array), Group Anaragams 
 * 
 * Prefix Sufix - Maximun Subarray - Kadane's Algorithm
 * Stack - Valid Parenthess, Taping Raing Water
 * Heap/Priority Queue - Kth Largest Element in an Array, Merge K Sorted Lists
 * BackTraing - subsets, Permutations, Combinations, Palindrome Partitioning,word Search in the grid, n Quees Problem(Too Tough)
 * Dynamic Programming - Maximun SubArray,  Coin Change, Climbing Stairs, House Robber, Longest Increasing Subsequence, Longest Common Subsequence 
 * Matrix - Search in a 2D Matrix, Set Matrix Zeroes, Spiral Matrix, Word Search in Grid, Rotate the Matrix
 *
